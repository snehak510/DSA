are reusables soltions to the problem that we encounter
solve object generation and integration 
3 Types :
1. Creational : object creation and initialisation. ex - singleton, factory, abstract facory, builder and prototype
2. Structural : class n object ccomposition. focuses on decoupling interface & implementation of classes. Ex - adapter, bridges
3. behavioural : communication between the classes n objects. Ex- chain of responsibility , command, interpreter etc
